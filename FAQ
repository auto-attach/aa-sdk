Q: What is Auto Attach?

A: Auto Attach is a compact method of using IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery
   Protocol (LLDP) with a IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to
   automatically attach network devices not supporting IEEE 802.1ah Provider
   Backbone Bridging (PBB) to individual services in a SPB network.  These
   network devices typically do not support SPBM, MAC- in-MAC (802.1ah), or
   I-SID usage and therefore cannot easily take advantage of the SPB
   infrastructure without manual configuration of attachment of VLANs to I-SIDs
   in multiple locations.  A motivation for this feature is to suggest a useful
   means to simplify and automate connections to PBB L2VPN based service
   networks such as those defined in SPBM-EVPN
