Auto Attach SDK

Shortest Path Bridging (SPBM) brings many benefits to network design but it
does require switch support for MAC-in-MAC encapsulation and support for a
means to distribute and maintain forwarding info on each SPBM switch. Hence
support for SPBM requires significant compute, IO and memory resources on each
switch. It is desirable to allow less capable edge devices to easily connect to
an SPBM network. The Auto Attach (AA) standard was devised to address this need.

This open source SW Development Kit (SDK) is provided to facilitate the
inclusion of Auto Attach support into these less capable edge devices. This SDK
is designed to allow Auto Attach to be incorporated into both virtual and
physical switches. An effort is underway which uses this SDK to add AA support
to Open Virtual Switch (OVS). This SDK can also be used to add AA support to
other virtual switch implementations. Similarly this SDK can be used to add AA
support to physical switches provided by any networking vendor.
